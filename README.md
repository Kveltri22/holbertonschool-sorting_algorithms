Sorting Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of several sorting algorithms along with animations of how they work.

Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Each algorithm is implemented in both Python and JavaScript.

Big O Notation

The time complexity of each algorithm is also included in the corresponding implementation file. Additionally, a summary of the Big O notation for each algorithm is provided below:

Algorithm	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Bubble Sort	O(n)	O(n^2)	O(n^2)
	Selection Sort	O(n^2)	O(n^2)	O(n^2)
	Insertion Sort	O(n)	O(n^2)	O(n^2)
	Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)
	Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n^2)
	Animations

	To help visualize how each algorithm works, there are animations included with each implementation. The print_array and print_list functions are used to display the arrays and lists at each iteration of the sorting process.

	How to Run

	To run the Python implementation of any algorithm, simply run the corresponding .py file. To run the JavaScript implementation, open the corresponding .html file in a web browser.

	Credits

	The code for the sorting algorithms is based on the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. The animations were created using the Python library matplotlib.
